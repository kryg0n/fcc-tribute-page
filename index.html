							KOFI A. ANNAN of Ghana, the seventh Secretary-General of the
							United Nations, served from 1997 to 2006 and was the first to
							emerge from the ranks of United Nations staff. One of Mr. Annan's
							main priorities as Secretary-General was a comprehensive programme
							of reform aimed at revitalizing the United Nations and making the
							international system more effective. He was a constant advocate
							for human rights, the rule of law, the Millennium Development
							Goals and Africa, and sought to bring the Organization closer to
							the global public by forging ties with civil society, the private
							sector and other partners.

						At Mr. Annan's initiative, UN peacekeeping was strengthened in ways
						that enabled the United Nations to cope with a rapid rise in the
						number of operations and personnel. It was also at Mr. Annan's
						urging that, in 2005, Member States established two new
						intergovernmental bodies: the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human
						Rights Council. Mr. Annan likewise played a central role in the
						creation of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria,
						the adoption of the UN's first-ever counter-terrorism strategy, and
						the acceptance by Member States of the ‚Äúresponsibility to protect‚Äù
						people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
						against humanity. His ‚ÄúGlobal Compact‚Äù initiative, launched in 1999,
						has become the world's largest effort to promote corporate social
						responsibility. Mr. Annan undertook wide-ranging diplomatic
						initiatives. In 1998, he helped to ease the transition to civilian
						rule in Nigeria . Also that year, he visited Iraq in an effort to
						resolve an impasse between that country and the Security Council
						over compliance with resolutions involving weapons inspections and
						other matters -- an effort that helped to avoid an outbreak of
						hostilities, which was imminent at that time. In 1999, he was deeply
						involved in the process by which Timor-Leste gained independence
						from Indonesia . He was responsible for certifying Israel 's
						withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, and in 2006, his efforts
						contributed to securing a cessation of hostilities between Israel
						and Hizbollah. Also in 2006, he mediated a settlement of the dispute
						between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi peninsula through
						implementation of the judgement of the International Court of
						Justice. His efforts to strengthen the Organization's management,
						coherence and accountability involved major investments in training
						and technology, the introduction of a new whistleblower policy and
						financial disclosure requirements, and steps aimed at improving
						coordination at the country level.

						Mr. Annan joined the UN system in 1962 as an administrative and
						budget officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva. He
						later served with the Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa,
						the UN Emergency Force (UNEF II) in Ismailia, the United Nations
						High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva, and in various
						senior posts in New York dealing with human resources, budget,
						finance and staff security. Immediately before becoming
						Secretary-General, he was Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping.
						Mr. Annan also served as Special Representative of the
						Secretary-General to the former Yugoslavia (1995-1996), and
						facilitated the repatriation from Iraq of more than 900
						international staff and other non-Iraqi nationals (1990).
